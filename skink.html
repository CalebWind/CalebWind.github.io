        <h3>Skink</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          Skinks are lizards belonging to the family Scincidae and the
          infraorder Scincomorpha. With more than 1,500 described species, the
          Scincidae are one of the most diverse families of lizards. Common
          skinks include many different kinds such as the slender skink,
          snake-eyed skink and the skinks of Plestiodon are among the common
          skinks.

          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            Skinks look like true lizards, but most species have no pronounced
            neck, and their legs are relatively small; several genera (e.g.,
            Typhlosaurus) have no limbs at all. The skink skull is covered by
            substantial bony scales, usually matching up in shape and size,
            while overlapping. Other genera, such as Neoseps, have reduced limbs
            and with fewer than five toes (digits) on each foot. In such
            species, their locomotion resembles that of snakes more than that of
            lizards with well-developed limbs. As a general rule, the longer the
            digits, the more arboreal the species is likely to be. A biological
            ratio can determine the ecological niche of a given skink species.
            The Scincidae ecological niche index is a ratio based on anterior
            foot length at the junction of the ulna/radius-carpal bones to the
            longest digit divided by the snout-to-vent length.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most species of skinks have long, tapering tails they can shed if
            predators grab onto them. Such species generally can regenerate the
            lost part of a tail, though imperfectly. If a skink loses part of
            its tail it can grow a tail in roughly three to four months. Species
            with stumpy tails have no special regenerative abilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some species of skinks are quite small; Scincella lateralis
            typically ranges from 7.5 to 14.5 cm (3.0 to 5.7 in), more than half
            of which is the tail. Most skinks, though, are medium-sized, with
            snout-to-vent lengths around 12 cm (4.7 in), although some grow
            larger; the Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata) is the largest
            known extant species and may attain a snout-to-vent length of some
            35 cm (14 in). Skinks can often hide easily in their habitat as
            their skin color often resembles its habitat.
