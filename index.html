        <h3>The Mongoose</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          Mongoose is the popular English name for 29 of the 34 species in the
          14 genera of the family Herpestidae, which are small feliform
          carnivorans native to southern Eurasia and mainland Africa. The other
          five species (all African) in the family are the four kusimanses in
          the genus Crossarchus, and the species Suricata suricatta, commonly
          called meerkat in English. Six species in the family Eupleridae are
          endemic to the island of Madagascar. These are called "mongoose" and
          were originally classified as a genus within the family Herpestidae,
          but genetic evidence has since shown that they are more closely
          related to other Madagascar carnivorans in the family Eupleridae; they
          have been classified in the subfamily Galidiinae within Eupleridae
          since 2006. Herpestidae is placed within the suborder Feliformia,
          together with the cat, hyena, and Viverridae families.

          <h4>Characteristics</h4>
          The 34 mongoose species range from 24 to 58 cm (9.4 to 22.8 in) in
          head to body length, excluding the tail. They range in weight from 320
          g (11 oz) to 5 kg (11 lb). They bear a striking resemblance to
          mustelids, having long faces and bodies, small, rounded ears, short
          legs, and long, tapering tails. Most are brindled or grizzly; a few
          have strongly marked coats. Their nonretractile claws are used
          primarily for digging. Mongooses, much like goats, have narrow, ovular
          pupils. Most species have a large anal scent gland, used for
          territorial marking and signaling reproductive status. Mongooses also
          have receptors for acetylcholine that, like the receptors in snakes,
          are shaped so that it is impossible for snake neurotoxin venom to
          attach to them. Mongooses are one of four known mammalian taxa with
          mutations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against
          snake venom. Pigs, honey badgers, hedgehogs, and mongooses all have
          modifications to the receptor pocket that prevents the snake venom
          Î±-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent
          mutations. In the mongoose, this change is effected uniquely, by
          glycosylation. Researchers are investigating whether similar
          mechanisms protect the mongoose from hemotoxic snake venoms.
