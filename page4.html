        <h3>The Komodo Dragon</h3>
        <article>
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo
          monitor, is a species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of
          Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang. A member of the monitor lizard
          family Varanidae, it is the largest living species of lizard, growing
          to a maximum length of 3 metres (10 ft) in rare cases and weighing up
          to approximately 70 kilograms (150 lb). Its unusually large size has
          been attributed to island gigantism, since no other carnivorous
          animals fill the niche on the islands where it lives. However, recent
          research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better
          understood as representative of a relict population of very large
          varanid lizards that once lived across Indonesia and Australia, most
          of which, along with other megafauna, died out after the Pleistocene
          (as a result of human activity).[1] Fossils very similar to V.
          komodoensis have been found in Australia dating to more than 3.8
          million years ago, and its body size remained stable on Flores, one of
          the small number of Indonesian islands where it is currently found,
          over the last 900,000 years, "a time marked by major faunal turnovers,
          extinction of the island's megafauna, and the arrival of early
          hominids by 880 ka [kiloannums].

          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            In the wild, an adult Komodo dragon usually weighs around 70 kg (150
            lb), although captive specimens often weigh more. According to
            Guinness World Records, an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91 kg
            (174 to 201 lb) and measure 2.59 m (8.5 ft), while an average female
            will weigh 68 to 73 kg (150 to 161 lb) and measure 2.29 m (7.5
            ft).[27] The largest verified wild specimen was 3.13 m (10.3 ft)
            long and weighed 166 kg (366 lb), including undigested food. Closeup
            of the skin The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as
            well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can
            measure up to 2.5 cm (1 in) in length. Its saliva is frequently
            blood-tinged, because its teeth are almost completely covered by
            gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. It also
            has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue. Komodo dragon skin is
            reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called
            osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail. This
            rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin a poor source of leather.
