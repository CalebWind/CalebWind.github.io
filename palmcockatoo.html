      <h3>Palm Cockatoo</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        The palm cockatoo is 55 to 60 cm (22 to 24 in) in length and weighs
        910–1,200 g (2.01–2.65 lb). It may be the largest cockatoo species and
        largest parrot in Australia, although large races of yellow-tailed black
        cockatoos and sulphur-crested cockatoos broadly overlap in size. It is a
        distinctive bird with a large crest and has one of the largest bills of
        any parrot (only the hyacinth macaw's is larger). This powerful bill
        enables palm cockatoos not only to eat very hard nuts and seeds, but
        also enables males to break off thick (about 1 in) sticks from live
        trees to use for a drumming display. The male has a larger beak than the
        female. The bill is unusual, as the lower and upper mandibles do not
        meet for much of its length, allowing the tongue to hold a nut against
        the top mandible while the lower mandible works to open it. The palm
        cockatoo also has a distinctive red cheek patch that changes colour when
        the bird is alarmed or excited. The palm cockatoo has a large and
        complex vocal repertoire, including many whistles and even a "hello"
        call that sounds surprisingly human-like. Distinct dialects occur
        throughout the species' range. Anecdotal evidence indicates a palm
        cockatoo reaching 80 or 90 years of age in an Australian zoo, although
        the oldest confirmed individual was aged 56 in London Zoo in 2000.
        Although longevity of captive birds is known, the lifespan of palm
        cockatoos that live in the wild is still unknown.

        <h4>Behaviour</h4>

        It has a unique territorial display where the bird (typically the male)
        drums with a large (i.e. up to 2.5 cm diameter, 15 cm long) stick or
        seed pod against a dead bough or tree, creating a loud noise that can be
        heard up to 100 m away. After drumming, the male occasionally strips the
        drum tool into small pieces to line the nest. Although this drumming
        behaviour was discovered over two decades ago (in 1984 by G.A. Wood),
        the reason why palm cockatoos drum is still a mystery. One reason could
        be that females can assess the durability of the nesting hollow by the
        resonance of the drumming. Another possibility could be that males drum
        to mark their territory against other males. The palm cockatoo is an
        unusual bird, being an ancient species and one of the few bird species
        known to use tools

              The vocalizations of palm cockatoos are similar to those of most
              wild parrots, but they have also been shown to produce a variety
              of additional syllables in display and exchange with neighbouring
              individuals. These additional syllables are mainly produced by
              males and are often combined to form long, complex sequences. In a
              population in the Iron Range, 30 different syllables were
              distinguished.

              This species normally does not appear in large numbers. They are
              not known to flock feed like many of the cockatoo species. Usually
              only one to six individuals are observed feeding together at one
              time. As with other large birds, both parents care for young, so
              seeing a breeding pair is not unusual. If these birds do
              congregate, it will usually happen in open woodland just after
              sunrise or along the rainforest edge before returning to
              individual roosts for the night.

            <td>
              Palm cockatoos only lay one egg every second year and have one of
              the lowest breeding success rates reported for any species of
              parrot. Offsetting this is their very long lifespan. A male
              commenced breeding at 29 in Taronga Zoo in Sydney, and a female at
              the London Zoo was 40 when she laid her first egg in 1966.
              Breeding takes place inside tree hollows that look like standing
              pipes. Fires play an important role in the destruction and
              creation of nest hollows. Fires allow the colonisation of
              microorganisms and termites, which enter the tree and start
              hollowing out the inside. Cyclones are important in the final
              stage of nest hollow development.
